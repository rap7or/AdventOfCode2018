# AdventOfCode2018

These are my solutions for the advent of code 2018 https://adventofcode.com/2018

My goal is to *try* and solve each one the day they come out, and document each day here.

# Day 1

Part one was a simple file iteration with some int values that represent frequencies,
and the goal was to find the final frequency. I used python3 and summed up the lines
in the file. Pretty straight forward. End result ended up being 420 _heh_.

Part two was to find the first frequecy that was repeated. The caviat was that the 
input could be looped more than once. Answer came to be 227
